# open~pi (っ◔◡◔)っ ~open~piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~

open-Pi is an open-source Python framework designed for AI-driven function calling between all open-source AI models. It supports any model with an endpoint that can parse and understand data via JSON and/or YAML formats

# why~tho?

think of Open-Pi as a versatile tool for integrating AI models, much like how Perl scripts can tie different elements together, with the user-friendliness of POSTMAN and the scheduling capabilities of CRON

### cool~stuff

**AI-Driven Function Calling**
Open-Pi includes optional private, locally hosted Ollama integration for automated agent moderation and management of your tool/function queue and operations

**Function and Tool Scheduling**
open-Pi allows scheduling and planning of function and tool calls, offering too many potential use cases to list

**Integration with All Open Source Models**
the framework is designed to work effortlessly with all open-source models, providing options outside of closed-source function/tool calling formats

**JSON and YAML Endpoints**
open-Pi offers endpoints for handling data in JSON and YAML formats. These widely used formats make Open-Pi super chill to use between different applications

**Community-Driven**
as an open-source project, Open-Pi welcomes you to build off/on/with this codebase
